Files for the USI Winter course 2022 Project Nine: building Smart Contracts in the Algorand blockchain

This is a nice development project that provides an entry path into the world of Algorand, data management, Analytics, etc.

The objective is to deliver a working application that can be used and expanded at a later stage, for more complex purposes.

This project was built in Visual Studio Code, using Python 3.9, the Flask webserver, the Algorand libraries for Python, Javascript, the Bootstrap framework, the Apexcharts charting libraries and the "superagent" AJAX library.

Please see "References.TXT" for a more detailed description of software and resources used.

Please see "Project Nine" PDF for a user's guide.

Always keep hacking!
